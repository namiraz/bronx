Median household income ranges from $27,000 to $35,000, with nearly 37.14% of the population falling beneath the poverty line. 

### In the heart of the Bronx

Since a majority of Belmont is residential, retail is concentrated along Arthur Avenue, which serves as the central shopping district for the area. Belmont is often dubbed Bronx’s Little Italy, and as such, it is famous for a large number of restaurants and bars serving Italian cuisine on Arthur Avenue as well. The attractions surrounding the town draw millions of visitors per year, and much of that traffic is directed towards the retail and eateries conveniently placed near public transportation hubs. Surprisingly, many store owners in the area reported an increase in business since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only one restaurant closed on Arthur Avenue between March and December of 2020, attributed to the fact that it was less than a year old; proving the loyalty and consistency of the consumer base and general population of Belmont, Bronx.
