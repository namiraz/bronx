Since a majority of Belmont is residential, retail is concentrated along Arthur Avenue, which serves as the central shopping district for the area. Belmont is often dubbed Bronx’s Little Italy. As such, it is famous for a large number of restaurants and bars serving the finest of Italian cuisine.

The attractions surrounding the town draw millions of visitors per year; much of that traffic is directed towards the retail and eateries conveniently placed near public transportation hubs.

Surprisingly, many store owners in the area reported an increase in business since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only one restaurant closed on Arthur Avenue between March and December of 2020, attributed to the fact that it was less than a year old. The grit of Belmont's businesses and restaurants and the loyalty of their consumer base is what has allowed for the neighborhood to thrive — even as we transition to pandemic-safe outdoor accomodations.

### A Foodie's Paradise

There are 3 critical factors when considering a neighborhood’s standard for outdoor dining: Safety, accessibility, and diversity.
- Consumers must be assured that they are protected and can enjoy their eating experience. 
- Ensuring that the broadest demographic have access is key: ease of transportation, sociocultural and economic approachability, and convenience matter.
- Variety of cuisine appeals to the most people. Visitors can reliably roam and find something to their liking no matter what.

Belmont has been praised for their tight-knit community, reporting a crime rate drop of 66% between 1993 and 2010. The popularity of nearby attractions has ensured that the neighborhood is littered with round-the-clock public and private transportation options. Hundreds of restaurants serving dishes authentic to a myriad of ethnic groups makes Belmont a hotpot of culture and diversity. With these factors in mind, this neighborhood is a knockout in the world of outdoor dining.

### Open Dining: The Statistics

Belmont’s open dining arrangements coincide with similar neighborhoods nearby; interestingly, its close proximity to major attraction sites has not turned it into a major statistical anomaly for the Bronx.

The Bronx reports the largest average sidewalk area out of the 5 boroughs:

As such, distribution between sidewalk, roadside, and open streets is consistent with others in the borough: an overwhelming number of restaurants serve on sidewalks and only a few serve on roadways.

One thing that has made Belmont's outdoor dining stand apart: About 70% of restaurants serve alcohol, which is higher than the average in the Bronx.

Despite the sheer amount of visitors flocking to the area, open dining has developed at the same pace as the rest of the borough; proving that the ever thriving Belmont has been able to salvage its eateries and nightlife after the transformation to the outdoors.
